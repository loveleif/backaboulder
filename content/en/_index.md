We want to boost the climbing culture in Gothenberg and Sweden by bringing together the indoor and outdoor climbing community, and to show the positive effects on mental and physical health that climbing gives.
Everyone is welcome here. Meet great people and new friends. Climb hard or not, make goals, break records or just have fun.
