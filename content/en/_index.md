# Backa Boulder

__We will be opening very soon__.

Welcome to Gothenburgs most modern climbing gym. Our building was constructed in 2017 and our climbing walls were made in 2021. We are a newly started bouldering gym in the middle of Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen, easily accessible from all of Gothenburg.

We want to promote climbing culture in Gothenburg and Sweden by clarifying the bond between indoor and outdoor climbing, and by showing the positive effects on mental and physical health that climbing brings. Everyone are welcome at our place. Regardless if you climb just because it's fun or if you climb to evolve and reach specific goals you will find what you need here. If you wish to develop your climbing skills we offer courses in kid climbing, youth training, beginner technique, advanced technique and injury prevention for climbers.

We have 350 square meters of climbing wall and a gym for you to discover. If you need energy we have lights snacks. After the workout you can recover in our sauna. There are also several restaurants, pubs, a billiard place and an escape room in the area. Why go in to the city when Hisingen has it all?
