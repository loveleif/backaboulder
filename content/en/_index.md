# Backa Boulder

Welcome to Gothenburgs most modern climbing gym. Our building was constructed 
in 2017 and our climbing walls were made in 2021. We are a newly started 
bouldering gym in the middle of Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen, easily accessible 
from all of Gothenburg.

We want to promote climbing culture in Gothenburg and Sweden by clarifying the 
bond between indoor and outdoor climbing, and by showing the positive effects 
on mental and physical health that climbing brings. Everyone are welcome at our 
place. Regardless if you climb just because it's fun or if you climb to evolve 
and reach specific goals you will find what you need here. If you wish to develop 
your climbing skills we offer courses in kid climbing, youth training, beginner 
technique, advanced technique and injury prevention for climbers.

We have 350 square meters of climbing wall and a gym for you to discover. If you 
need energy we have lights snacks. After the workout you can recover in our sauna. 
There are also several restaurants, pubs, a billiard place and an escape room in 
the area. Why go in to the city when Hisingen has it all?
