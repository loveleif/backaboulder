## Backa Boulder

Welcome to Gothenburg's most modern climbing gym. Our premises were built in 2017 and
the climbing walls in 2021. We are a newly started Boulder gym in the middle of Hjalmar
Brantingsplatsen. It is easy to get here from all over Gothenburg.

We want to promote climbing in Gothenburg and Sweden by showing the band
between indoor and outdoor climbing, as well as the positive effects of climbing
for both physical and mental health. With us, everyone is welcome to develop
their climbing ability to reach their goals. If you want help with
this you can take one of our courses, child climbing, youth training,
beginner technology or advanced technology.

Contact us if you want to rent the entire hall with staff for children's parties,
company groups, bachelor party / bachelorette party or similar.
