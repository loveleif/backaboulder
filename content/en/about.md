## About

We have more than 300 square meters of climbing wall for you to explore. If you need
more energy, there is coffee, tea, snacks and light refreshments in our caf√©.
After the workout, you can relax in our sauna. In the area there are also several goa
restaurants, pubs and other entertainment activities to take part in. Why go in to
town when everything is on Backaplan?
