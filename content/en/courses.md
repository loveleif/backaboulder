## Kids climbing

The kids climbing is most suitable for kids in the age of 7-10. Here the kids climb together with an experienced instructor. Focus is on having a good time and challenging ourselves based on our personnal conditions, when it's appropriate.

## Youth training

The youth climbing is most suitable for youth in the age of 11-14. Here the participants climb with an experienced instructor who guides them as a group that works together, and as individuals with personal strengths and areas to work on. Climbing is a lot of fun, it is important though to know that it can be burdensome for our bodies. Therefore we focus on establishing healthy climbing habits at our youth training. We also work to create an empowering atmosphere were the participants learn to work together in order to find solutions, and to push each other in order to reach success together.
