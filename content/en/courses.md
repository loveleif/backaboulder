## Kids climbing

Most suitable for kids in the age of 7-10. Here we climb with our kids and an experienced instructor. Focus is on having a good time and challenging ourselves based on our personnal conditions, when it's appropriate.

## Youth training

Most suitable for youth in the age of 11-14. Here the participants climb with an experienced instructor who guides them as a group that works together, and as individuals with personal strengths and areas to work on. Climbing is a lot of fun, it is important though to know though that it can be burdensome for our bodies. Therefore we focus on establishing healthy climbing habits at our youth training. We also work to create an empowering atmosphere were the participants learn to work together in order to find solutions, and to push each other in order to reach success together.   

## Beginners technique

Most suitable for you who have been climbing for up to a year or so and wish to reach new heights. We go through all the climbing specific movements and train them properly in order for to climb more efficiently. What was earlier hard will become easy.

## Advanced technique

Most suitable for you who have been climbing for more than 3 years or so. Here we will go in depth and look at your weaknesses to develop a plan for you to strengthen them and raise your lowest level. We also go through injury prevention  training for climbers so that you can keep on climbing for eternity.

## Injury prevention training for climbers

This course is given continuously when needed. We go through warm up, stretching, light weight training for antagonists and building of joints and tendons for climbing.
