# Concerning Covid-19

Our space is 628 square metres. We have an upper limit of 40 visitors at once. 
One session is max 2 hours long. We can then have at least 10 square metres of 
space each. If you are wondering how many persons are climbing at us, give us 
a call and we’ll tell you alla bout it.

Stay at home if you feel sick, nauseous, feverish, snotty, unusually tired or 
have a soar throat of dry cough.

Wash your hands before and after your session. We have soap and hand sanitizer 
easily available. Don’t touch yourself (or others) in the face during your 
session.

Feel free to use a mask. 

If possible, change your clothes before coming to us and shower when you get 
home. The changing rooms and showers are open but there is a maximum limit 
of one person in there simultaneously. The sauna is unfortunately closed as 
of now. 

Our courses are unfortunately closed for the time being. But you can register 
you interest to secure a spot when we can start running them.
