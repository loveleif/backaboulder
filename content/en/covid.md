# Concerning Covid-19

Our space is 628 square metres. We have an upper limit of 45 visitors at once. We can then, theoretically, have at least 10 square metres of space each. We are currently practising a booking system for climbing in the gym. This means that you need to book a time slot for when you want to visit us. The slots are 2 hours long, the last 15 minutes are used for emptying the space so that it’s empty when the next slot starts. You can book yourself to maximum 2 upcoming slots at once, one week in advance. If you more than twice book a slot and then can’t attend it and don’t cancel the booking at least 4 hours in advance we will freeze your account and it will cost 50 SEK to unfreeze it. If a time slot isn’t fully booked you can come by drop-in and climb. 

Stay at home if you feel sick, nauseous, feverish, snotty, unusually tired or have a soar throat of dry cough.
Wash your hands before and after your session. We have soap and hand sanitizer easily available. Don’t touch yourself (or others) in the face during your session. 

Feel free to use a mask. 

If possible, change your clothes before coming to us and shower when you get home. The changing rooms and showers are open but there is a maximum limit of 2 persons in there simultaneously. The sauna is unfortunately closed until further notice. 

Our courses are unfortunately closed for the time being. But you can register you interest to secure a spot when we can start running them.
