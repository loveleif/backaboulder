# Concerning Covid-19

Our space is 628 square metres. If you are wondering how many persons are climbing at us, 
give us a call and we’ll tell you all about it.

Stay at home if you feel sick, nauseous, feverish, snotty, unusually tired or 
have a soar throat of dry cough.

Wash your hands before and after your session. We have soap and hand sanitizer 
easily available. Don’t touch yourself (or others) in the face during your 
session.

Feel free to use a mask.
