# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is bouldering?

Bouldering is a form of climbing without hassles. We climb freely without ropes and there is no need for prior knowledge or certification. Bouldering is one of the fastest growing sports in the world. Itâ€™s a very social activity as you climb with others and work on solutions in order to reach success together. We climb on 4-5 metre high walls with customised thick safety matts on the floor. It's easy to get the hang of it and you get strong fast as you constantly pull up your body weight on holds on the wall. It's also mentally challenging as you need to figure out which sequence you need to use to complete specific climbs, and you need to fight of your height induced doubts. 

## Do you have any beginner walls?
  
At Backa Boulder every individual climb (also known as "problem") has been made with specific solutions in mind. There are different levels of difficulty that suits first timers all the way up to experts. It's upon you to figure out the solution, or get creative and find your own solution. Sometimes strength is the best way to get up, other times it's balance, body positioning etc. We all have differently constituted bodies that are good at doing their own thing. Some of us are better at maximum strength, others are better at balance or endurance, etc. In bouldering you will find out your strengths and you will be given the oppurtunity to work on your weaknesses. 

## What are grades?
  
We use a grading scale for the different problems that is based in font style grading. This means that our problems are given an approximate grade that gives you an idea of how hard the problem is. Grades are subjective and our personal strengths and weaknesses will influence our experience of specific problems. That's why we use approximate grades, here's how it works:

- 5-ish this is the easiest grade
- 6A-ish
- 6B-ish
- 6C-ish
- 7A-ish
- 7B-ish
- 7C-ish
- 8A-ish this is the hardest grade

## Are there any rules? 

There is some climbing etiquette and some tips that you should know in order to be safe and have as good a time as possible. If you are unsure feel free to ask us about it and we'll sort you out in a minute or two, it's all pretty simple. 

## What do I need to bring?  

The only thing you really need is clothes that you can move freely in. You can rent climbing shoes and chalk here if you don't have your own, and we will give you an introduction if you are a beginner.
